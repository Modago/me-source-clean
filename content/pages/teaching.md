## Teaching and Tutoring
I have assisted in tutoring international students in the GS3D masters programme from 2015.

Other teaching responsibilities have been in graduate education. I have taught and assisted in teaching courses such as Enterprise Systems, Emerging Technologies and Issues, Next Generation of the Web, Usability Testing and Systems Design Methods for Information Systems. Courses are framed on a knowledge base and incorporate hands-on learning, quizzes, exercises that build on each other, and individual work that aims to further motivate students’ learning.

### Course Listing
**The Next Generation of the Web**
    <ul>
        <li>28 students, Spring 2018, University of&nbsp;Oulu</li>
        <li>Aims of the course:
            <ul>
                <li>Analyse the characteristics of various web-based&nbsp;technologies</li>
                <li>Understand how the future Web will be shaped by ongoing trends and technological&nbsp;improvements</li>
                <li>Understand different techniques for predicting future technological changes and how to apply these to problems in different&nbsp;domains</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

**Emerging Technology and Issues**
    <ul>
        <li>2 student groups 23/35 in Spring and Autumn&nbsp;2018</li>
        <li>Theoretical and practical background for understanding: 
            <ul>
                <li>History and development of the Web and how the Web fosters&nbsp;innovation</li>
                <li>The advantages and disadvantages of the&nbsp;Web.</li>
                <li>Other related technical and social&nbsp;developments.</li>
