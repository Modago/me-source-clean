The main articles included in my PhD are:
<ol>
    <li>A literature review that used the Persuasive Systems Design (<span class="caps">PSD</span>) model’s persuasion context analyses to review behavioural economics studies in the main <span class="caps">IS</span> journals <strong>(Oduor and Oinas-Kukkonen, 2017)</strong>. </li>
    <li>A study that used the <span class="caps">PSD</span> model to examine the persuasive features of a system developed based on the concepts investigated in the first study <strong>(Oduor and Oinas-Kukkonen, 2017)</strong>. </li>
    <li>A feature-level analysis <strong>(Oduor and Oinas-Kukkonen, 2015)</strong> examining various social web systems persuasive software features. Both studies 2 and 3 examined how persuasive software features in different systems facilitate user engagement and influence&nbsp;behaviour. </li>
    <li>Based on the findings of the preceding studies, the other two articles proposed the development of persuasive software design patterns. These patterns were based on the <span class="caps">PSD</span> model’s human-computer dialogue (<strong>(Oduor and Oinas-Kukkonen, 2017)</strong> and social support features <strong>(Oduor and Oinas-Kukkonen, 2014)</strong> which were found to be important in enhancing user engagement and influencing user&nbsp;behaviours.</li>
